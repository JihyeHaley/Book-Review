# Book-Review
This is Book section😃.
Once upon a time... I was super crazy in reading books.. Belive it or not!!!! 📚 

I was falling in Essays(수필, 에세이전) for 4 years since I was a little bit sentimental student who was dreaming and imaging what future I can do and create 🌊.

The most important books was 'Singularity is near'. 
But, currently, in both preparing new project and ***studying UX/UI*** (also waiting for the result of ***graduate school of Yonsei University for Deisgn Intelligence*** which makes me so trumble and excited..!!! anyway! ) , 
reading books about Design is get more excited. I thought books are collection of knowledge, but nowadyas it is underestimated as old information.. I was so sad. I think this way 👉🏼 " ***knowing the past and rights is giving me plenty of chance to create something new and right way to design.***"



So! Too long descriptions.... 

I will upload *every Sunday* with new feelings and contents!



🗂 now reading: **'도널드 노먼의 디자인 심리학'** Donald Norman Emotional Design
